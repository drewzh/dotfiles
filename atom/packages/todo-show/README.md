Ignores anything in your .gitignore.

## Coming features (PR's welcome)
- ~~TODO, FIXME, CHANGED included in search~~
- goto result should start at comment, NOT at todo symbol
- don't open multiple search windows when we search multiple times
- how do we handle file changes?
- nicer styling
- ignore TODOs outside of comment blocks
- have nice message when no results are found
- refactor and clean up code
- fix / add keymap shortcut
- add test cases

Inspired by the textmate TODO bundle.
